Here you will find the additional supplementary data that belongs to "Bacterial homologs of innate eukaryotic antiviral defenses provide phage protection"

Provided data includes:
- The raw PPanGGOLiN results of the 542 Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes that were analysed in this study. This data will be made public upon publication (sadly not the bioRxiv).
- The supplementary tables, these include a list of all literature-associated functional domains with eukaryotic antiviral responses, 
  all information regarding the modules identified by PPanGGOLiN, the presence of the new defense systems within prokaryotes, 
  the abundance of the defense systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the primers and plasmids used in this study.
- Additional supplementary tables, including summary data and the locations of the known defense systems and the modules.
- All identified defense systems by Padloc, defense-finder, a custom search for detocs, and the HMM profiles provided by Gao et al. (2019).
- The phylogenetic tree made by Parsnp from the 542 Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes that were analysed in this study
- All HMM profiles of the newly discovered defense systems in this study
- All predicted alphafold models and output
- All experimental lab data, including EOPs of the systems and mutant systems, growth curves, and PFUs over time (phage propagation in liquid).
- Lastly, all the HMM profiles that were created from the eukaryotic homologs. These HMM profiles will be made public upon publication (sadly not the bioRxiv).
